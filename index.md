These pre-exercises are designed to prepare you for the CMS Open Data Workshop
by introducing you to some of the basic concepts used by experimentalists. The exercises
are often presented with more basic tools than you will use for a full analysis, which
will hopefully allow you to focus on the concepts and not the computing challenges.
